# Basic-AI
Set of basic AI to analise movie data to predict if said movie is recommended to watch or not

Basic AI made to study the creation process of AI, here it was made a Neural Network, Naive Bayers and KNN using a dataset based on the Internet Movie Database (IMDB),
it was a group colaboration involving me and other people as a school project.

need to learn how keras callback and/or ModeCheckpoint work, as it stand i don't think it all that useful
